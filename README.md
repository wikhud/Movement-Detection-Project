# Movement-Detection-Project
This script uses OpenCV to perform motion detection in real-time using a webcam. It captures consecutive frames, converts them to grayscale, applies Gaussian blurring and calculates the absolute difference between consecutive frames. The script then thresholds the difference, detects motion based on contour areas and draws bounding box around it.
